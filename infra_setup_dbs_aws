Creating a Cassandra Database on AWS
--------------------------------------
1. Set Up IAM Permissions
Go to the AWS IAM service.

2.Create a User (if needed):

  Navigate to Users and click Add user.
  Enter a user name (e.g., cassandra_user), select Programmatic access, and AWS Management Console access if required.
  Attach existing policies or create a new policy for Cassandra and S3 access.

Policy Example:
--------------
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:StartInstances",
                "ec2:StopInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::cassandra",
                "arn:aws:s3:::cassandra/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

3. Create an S3 Bucket
------------------------
Go to the S3 service.
  Click Create bucket.
  Name the bucket cassandra.
  Configure options as needed and click Create bucket.
4  . Create a VPC and Subnets
    Create a VPC:
    Go to the VPC service.
    Click Create VPC.
    Enter an IPv4 CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16) and create the VPC.
    Create Subnets:

    In the VPC Dashboard, click Subnets and then Create subnet.
    Enter details:
    IPv4 CIDR block: Define CIDR blocks for subnets (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24).
    Create the subnets.
5. Create and Attach an Internet Gateway
      Create an Internet Gateway:
      Go to the VPC Dashboard and click Internet Gateways.
      Click Create internet gateway, enter a name (e.g., MyInternetGateway), and create the gateway.
      Attach the Internet Gateway to Your VPC:

Select the gateway you created.
Click Actions > Attach to VPC.
Choose your VPC and click Attach Internet Gateway.

6. Create NAT Gateways
    Go to the VPC Dashboard and click NAT Gateways.
    Click Create NAT gateway and configure it as needed.
    Allocate an Elastic IP address and associate it with the NAT Gateway.
7. Configure Route Tables
    Go to the VPC Dashboard and click Route Tables.
    Click Create route table.

Enter a name (e.g., MyRouteTable).
    Select your VPC.
    Click Create route table.
    Add Routes:

Select the route table you created.
    Click Actions > Edit routes.
    Click Add route:
    Destination: Enter 0.0.0.0/0 for internet access.
    Target: Select the Internet Gateway you created.
    Click Save routes.
8. Configure Network ACLs (Optional)
    Go to the VPC Dashboard and click Network ACLs.

    Click Create network ACL.

    Enter a name (e.g., MyNetworkACL).
    Select your VPC.
    Click Create network ACL.
    Configure Inbound and Outbound Rules:

Select the network ACL you created.
Click Inbound rules or Outbound rules and then Edit inbound rules or Edit outbound rules.
Add rules based on your requirements (e.g., allow traffic on Cassandra port 9092).
Click Save changes.

Summary::-
    VPC:               Creates a private network within AWS.
    Subnets:           Divides the VPC into smaller segments for different uses.
    Internet Gateway:  Allows instances in your VPC to access the internet.
    Route Tables:      Manages routing of traffic within the VPC.
    Security Groups:  Controls inbound and outbound traffic to your instances.
    Network ACLs:     Provides an additional layer of security at the subnet level.
